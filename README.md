# text-cluster-viewer
A repository for a static app to view the clusters associated with one main text

### To do
- Fix json building script to mark clusters that have a size with two decimal places - e.g. @clb@19@154618885446@
- Adjust cl tagging function to allow poetry tags %~% rather than strip them out
- Adjust mARkdown_to_html function to add formatting for poetry (add a class type)
- Add poetry class type to css
